## Security Considerations

Protect your integrations with best practices.

<Callout kind="alert">
  Never expose `{YOUR_API_KEY}` in client-side code or public repos. Use environment variables and rotate keys regularly.
</Callout>

- Validate webhook payloads with HMAC signatures.
- Restrict API scopes to minimum required permissions.
- Monitor integration logs at `https://dashboard.example.com/logs`.

For advanced setups, enable IP whitelisting in account settings.
