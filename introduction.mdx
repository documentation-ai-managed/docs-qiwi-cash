## Brand Guidelines

<Expandable title="Primary Brand Color" default-open="true">
  Use our primary brand color `#3B82F6` for headers, buttons, and accents to maintain consistency.

  ```css
  :root {
    --primary-color: #3B82F6;
  }

  .header {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    color: white;
  }
  ```

  Avoid using it for text-only elements to ensure readability.
